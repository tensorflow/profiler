"""Events DB Python API for high-performance accelerator trace analysis.

Record Consumer Semantics & Lifecycle (Transient Record Views):
  When consuming streamed events (via `RecordConsumerRef` or callbacks passed
  to trace parsers), the `Record` instance passed to `consume(record)` is a
  transient, non-owning view directly referencing memory managed by the C++
  parser.

  - Parser Ownership & Memory Reuse:
    To maximize parsing throughput and avoid allocation churn across millions
    of events, the C++ parser retains ownership of the underlying `Record`
    buffer and reuses it across iterations.

  - Lifetime & Cross-Thread Invalidation Warning:
    Consumers MUST NOT retain references or pointers to the `Record` after the
    callback returns, nor pass the `Record` instance to other threads (e.g.
    `threading.Thread`, `queue.Queue`, or thread pools). Doing so causes data
    races, memory corruption, or segmentation faults when the parser clears,
    reuses, or destructs the underlying C++ record:

      ```py
      # DANGEROUS: Storing raw `Record` instances retains transient views!
      def bad_consumer(record: events_db.Record):
        records_list.append(record)  # BUG: Cleared/mutated on next iteration!
        background_queue.put(record)  # BUG: Not thread-safe! Data race!
      ```

  - Safe Usage:
    Extract required field values or copy needed data into independent Python
    structures (such as `dict`, `tuple`, or dataclasses) during the callback:

      ```py
      # SAFE: Extract field values into independent Python objects
      def safe_consumer(record: events_db.Record):
        records_list.append({
            name_field: record[name_field],
            dur_field: record[dur_field],
            tensors_field: tuple(record[tensors_field]),
        })
      ```

Parquet Exporting & Streaming:
  Events DB provides `ParquetRecordConsumer` for streaming trace events
  directly to Apache Parquet files without materializing intermediate records
  in Python.

  - Direct Zero-GIL C++ Streaming:
    When passed to `parse_xspace_file` or `parse_xspace_bytes`, the C++ parser
    detects `ParquetRecordConsumer` and streams records directly into batched
    Parquet row groups across multiple worker threads without acquiring the
    Python GIL.

    ```py
    schema = events_db.Schema()
    events_db.parse_xspace_file(
        "trace.xplane.pb",
        schema,
        events_db.ParquetRecordConsumer(
            schema,
            "trace.parquet",
            events_db.ParquetExportOptions(
                batch_size=65536,
                compression_type=events_db.ArrowCompressionType.SNAPPY)))
    ```

"""Type alias for any supported field value in an Events DB `Record`.

Type Conversion (Untyped Python to Strongly-Typed C++):
  Python is dynamically typed and represents all integers as arbitrary-precision
  `int` objects and all sequences as heterogeneous containers (e.g., `list` or
  `tuple`). In contrast, the underlying C++ `Record` stores values in a strictly
  typed object supporting specific scalar widths (`bool`, `int32_t`, `uint32_t`,
  `int64_t`, `uint64_t`, `double`, `std::string`) and homogeneous sequences of
  these types.

  When using generic assignment (`record[field] = val` or
  `record.set(field, val)`), the type is inferred using default mappings:
  - Scalar integers map to `int64_t` (or `uint64_t` if >= 2**63).
  - Floats map to `double`.
  - Homogeneous integer sequences map to sequences of `int64_t`.
  - Homogeneous float sequences map to sequences of `double`.
  - Homogeneous string sequences map to sequences of `std::string`.
  - Empty sequences default to sequences of `int64_t`.

  Explicit Typed Setters:
  Because generic assignment cannot infer narrower integer types (such as
  `int32_t` or `uint32_t`), and incurs dynamic element-inspection overhead for
  sequences, `Record` provides explicit typed setter methods. These allow
  direct specification of the underlying C++ storage type to optimize memory
  and performance:
  - Scalars: `set_bool`, `set_int32`, `set_uint32`, `set_int64`, `set_uint64`,
    `set_double`, `set_string`
  - Sequences: `set_int32_sequence`, `set_uint32_sequence`,
    `set_int64_sequence`, `set_uint64_sequence`, `set_double_sequence`,
    `set_string_sequence`

Repeated Field Semantics (Zero-Copy Sequence Views):
  When reading repeated fields (i.e., `Sequence[int]`, `Sequence[float]`, or
  `Sequence[str]`), the returned object is a read-only, zero-copy view directly
  into the underlying C++ memory.

  - Complexity: Supports true O(1) constant-time random access (`__getitem__`)
    and O(1) length calculation (`__len__`).

  - Lifetime & Invalidation Warning:
    The view's underlying memory is tied to the parent `Record`. While Python's
    garbage collector ensures the parent `Record` remains alive as long as the
    view exists, mutative operations on the `Record` (such as overwriting the
    field or calling `record.clear()`) destroy or reallocate the C++ underlying
    memory. Dereferencing a view after modifying that field causes undefined
    behavior or segmentation faults:

      ```py
      tensors = record[input_tensors]  # Zero-copy view into C++ container

      # DANGEROUS: Overwriting the field destroys the C++ container!
      record[input_tensors] = ["new_tensor"]  # or: record.clear()

      # CRASH / UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR: Dereferencing dangling C++ memory
      print(tensors[0])
      ```

  - Safe Usage:
    Treat returned sequence views as transient. If values must be retained
    while modifying the parent `Record`, explicitly copy elements into an
    independent Python `tuple` or `list`:

      ```py
      # SAFE: Create an independent Python copy before modifying record
      safe_tensors = tuple(record[input_tensors])

      record[input_tensors] = ["new_tensor"]
      print(safe_tensors[0])  # Safe: safe_tensors is an independent copy
      ```
