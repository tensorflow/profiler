## About

XProf offers a number of tools to analyse and visualize the performance of your
model across multiple devices. Some of the tools include:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="25%">
      <h3>Overview Page</h3>
      A high-level overview of the performance of your model. This
    is an aggregated overview for your host and all devices. It includes:
<ul>
<li>Performance summary and breakdown of step times.</li>
<li>A graph of individual step times.</li>
<li>High level details of the run environment.</li>
</ul>
    </td>
    <td valign="top" width="25%">
      <h3>Trace Viewer</h3>
      Displays a timeline of the execution of your model that shows:
<ul>
<li>The duration of each op.</li>
<li>Which part of the system (host or device) executed an op.</li>
<li>The communication between devices.</li>
</ul>
    </td>
    <td valign="top" width="25%">
      <h3>Memory Profile</h3>
      Monitors the memory usage of your model.

## Installation

To get the most recent release version of XProf, install it via pip:

```
$ pip install xprof
```

**Alternative installation options:**

<details>

<summary>Installation with Tensorboard</summary>

```
$ pip install xprof tensorboard
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Google Cloud</summary>

If you use Google Cloud to run your workloads, we recommend the [xprofiler tool](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/cloud-diagnostics-xprof).It provides a streamlined profile collection and viewing experience using VMs running XProf.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Nightly Releases</summary>

Every night, a nightly version of the package is released under the name of
`xprof-nightly`. This package contains the latest changes made by the XProf
developers.

To install the nightly version of profiler:

```
$ pip uninstall xprof tensorboard-plugin-profile
$ pip install xprof-nightly
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Build from Source</summary>

If the pip packages don't work, you can build XProf from source using
Bazel.

**1. Set up Bazel**

Bazel is the build system used for XProf. Bazelisk is a wrapper for Bazel that
simplifies Bazel version management. Download the appropriate `.deb` package for
your system from the [Bazelisk releases
page](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases) and install the
downloaded package:

```
sudo apt install ~/Downloads/bazelisk-amd64.deb
```

**2. Obtain the Repository**

Clone the XProf GitHub repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/openxla/xprof.git
cd xprof
```

**3. Build the Project**

Build the pip Package: Use Bazel to build the XProf pip package:

```
bazel run --config=public_cache plugin:build_pip_package
```

Navigate to the Bazel Output Directory and install:

```
cd /tmp/profile-pip
pip install .
```

</details>

## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> XProf requires access to the Internet to load the [Google Chart
> library](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/basic_load_libs#basic-library-loading).
> Some charts and tables may be missing if you run XProf entirely offline on
> your local machine, behind a corporate firewall, or in a datacenter.

### Standalone

If you have profile data in a directory (e.g., `profiler/demo`), you can view it
by running:

```
$ xprof --logdir=profiler/demo --port=6006
```

Or with the optional command name:

```
$ xprof server --logdir=profiler/demo --port=6006
```

### With TensorBoard

If you have TensorBoard installed, you can run:

```
$ tensorboard --logdir=profiler/demo
```

If you are behind a corporate firewall, you may need to include the `--bind_all`
tensorboard flag.

Go to `localhost:6006/#profile` of your browser, you should now see the demo
overview page show up. Congratulations\! You're now ready to capture a profile.

### Command-Line Arguments

When launching the XProf server from the command line, you can use the following
arguments:

<sup>1</sup> You can dynamically load profiles using `session_path` or `run_path` URL parameters, as described in the [Log Directory Structure](#log-directory-structure) section.

### Log Directory Structure

When using XProf, profile data must be placed in a specific directory structure.
XProf expects `.xplane.pb` files to be in the following path:

```
<log_dir>/plugins/profile/<session_name>/
```

  * `<log_dir>`: This is the root directory that you supply to `tensorboard
    --logdir`.
  * `plugins/profile/`: This is a required subdirectory.
  * `<session_name>/`: Each subdirectory inside `plugins/profile/` represents a
    single profiling session. The name of this directory will appear in the
    TensorBoard UI dropdown to select the session.

**Example:**

If your log directory is structured like this:

```
/path/to/your/log_dir/
└── plugins/
    └── profile/
        ├── my_experiment_run_1/
        │   └── host0.xplane.pb
        └── benchmark_20251107/
            └── host1.xplane.pb
```

You would launch TensorBoard with:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir /path/to/your/log_dir/
```

The runs `my_experiment_run_1` and `benchmark_20251107` will be available in the
"Sessions" tab of the UI.

You can also dynamically load sessions from a GCS bucket or local filesystem by
passing URL parameters when loading XProf in your browser. This method works
whether or not you provided a `logdir` at startup and is useful for viewing
profiles from various locations without restarting XProf.

For example, if you start XProf with no log directory:

```bash
xprof server
```

You can load sessions using the following URL parameters.

Assume you have profile data stored on GCS or locally, structured like this:

```
gs://your-bucket/profile_runs/
├── my_experiment_run_1/
│   ├── host0.xplane.pb
│   └── host1.xplane.pb
└── benchmark_20251107/
    └── host0.xplane.pb
```

There are two URL parameters you can use:

  * **`session_path`**: Use this to load a *single* session directly. The path
    should point to a directory containing `.xplane.pb` files for one session.

      * GCS Example:
        `http://localhost:8791/?session_path=gs://your-bucket/profile_runs/my_experiment_run_1`
      * Local Path Example:
        `http://localhost:8791/?session_path=/path/to/profile_runs/my_experiment_run_1`
      * Result: XProf will load the `my_experiment_run_1` session, and you will
        see its data in the UI.

  * **`run_path`**: Use this to point to a directory that contains *multiple*
    session directories.

      * GCS Example:
        `http://localhost:8791/?run_path=gs://your-bucket/profile_runs/`
      * Local Path Example:
        `http://localhost:8791/?run_path=/path/to/profile_runs/`
      * Result: XProf will list all session directories found under `run_path`
        (i.e., `my_experiment_run_1` and `benchmark_20251107`) in the "Sessions"
        dropdown in the UI, allowing you to switch between them.

**Loading Precedence**

If multiple sources are provided, XProf uses the following order of precedence
to determine which profiles to load:

1.  **`session_path`** URL parameter
2.  **`run_path`** URL parameter
3.  **`logdir`** command-line argument

### Distributed Profiling

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, distributed processing only benefits the following tools:
> `overview_page`, `framework_op_stats`, `input_pipeline`, and `pod_viewer`.

XProf supports distributed profile processing by using an aggregator that
distributes work to multiple XProf workers. This is useful for processing large
profiles or handling multiple users.

> [!NOTE]
> The ports used in these examples (`6006` for the aggregator HTTP
> server, `9999` for the worker HTTP server, and `50051`
> for the worker gRPC server) are suggestions and can be customized.

**Worker Node**

Each worker node should run XProf with a gRPC port exposed so it can receive
processing requests. You should also hide the capture button as workers are not
meant to be interacted with directly.

```
$ xprof server --grpc_port=50051 --port=9999 --hide_capture_profile_button
```

**Aggregator Node**

The aggregator node runs XProf with the `--worker_service_address` flag pointing
to all available workers. Users will interact with aggregator node's UI.

```
$ xprof server --worker_service_address=<worker1_ip>:50051,<worker2_ip>:50051 --port=6006 --logdir=profiler/demo
```

Replace `<worker1_ip>, <worker2_ip>` with the addresses of your worker machines.
Requests sent to the aggregator on port 6006 will be distributed among the
workers for processing.

For deploying a distributed XProf setup in a Kubernetes environment, see
[Kubernetes Deployment Guide](docs/kubernetes_deployment.md).
